# Recount
 
Re-count is device
for measuring
time as perceived
subjectively by
humans.
By demonstrating with an
audio archive of intervieweesâ€™
most powerful memories
how emotions alter
our experience of time, it
aims to help machines
understand us better.
Simultaneously, by
harnessing stories of
love and grief, it seeks
also to be an interface
that highlights our
shared connection as
human beings and
encourage empathy
between people.
